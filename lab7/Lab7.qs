    /// register. Both are of unknown length, but they have the same length.
    /// Your goal is to apply the bitwise XOR operation in-place on the
    /// quantum register, using its own state and the classical bit array as
    /// the two input arguments, and using the register itself as the output.
    /// For example, if the classical bit array is 10110 and the qubit
    /// register is in the state |00101>, then this operation should put the
    /// qubit register into the state 10110 XOR 00101 = |10011>.

    /// classicalBits array.

    /// encryption key being checked, and a target qubit. Your goal is to
