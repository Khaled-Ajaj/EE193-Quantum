//
// Due 1/30 at 6:00PM ET:
//  - Completed exercises and evidence of unit tests passing uploaded to GitHub.
//  - Link to your GitHub repo shared in your private Discord channel.
//
//
// --- First Time Setup Instructions ---
//
//  1. Install .NET 6.0 SDK: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download
//  2. Install VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
//  3. Install the Microsoft QDK for VS Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.quantum-devkit-vscode
//  4. Open the "Lab1" folder in VS Code.
//  5. Open the terminal with Ctrl + `. Run the command "dotnet test". The tests
//     should fail.
//  6. Modify the code in this file so the unit tests pass. Do not modify the
//     tests.
//
// If the above instructions do not work for you, DON'T PANIC! Post in the #help
// channel on Discord, or use your private channel if you'd prefer.
//
//
// --- Recommended Extensions ---
//
//  - C#: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp
//  - .NET Core Test Explorer: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.dotnet-test-explorer
//
//
// --- Tips ---
//
//  - To target an individual test, use the --filter flag. For example,
//    "dotnet test --filter Exercise1".
//  - Don't forget to remove the fail statements!
//  - If your .csproj file gets messed up or you are having version issues, you
//    can create a new project and copy the assignment and unit tests over. See
//    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/user-guide/testing-debugging?tabs=tabid-vscode#creating-a-test-project
